              I‚Äôm Annie Salis, a Frontend Engineer and Virtual Assistant.
              With a robust background in front-end development,
               I specialize in crafting user-friendly, aesthetically appealing websites
                and interfaces using HTML, CSS, BootStrap and JavaScript, and React.js.
                <br> <br>
                I thrive on building functional and innovative solutions, 
                 and my current project is a "Budget and Expense Tracker" 
                 app designed to help users streamline their expenses.
               My aim is to combine creativity with technology to deliver 
               meaningful and impactful solutions to everyday problems. 
               <br> <br>
               My tech journey started in 2020, learning JavaScript, I was interrupted 
               by the demands of my banking career. But once I took the leap in 2023, 
               I fully immersed myself in Web Development/Engineering, gaining skills in
                JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

              <br> <br>

              Currently a master's student at the University of Porto,
               blending creativity and strategy to enhance organizational 
               communications. 
               <br> <br>
              Before fully transitioning into Tech, I was in the Banking Industry
               where I worked as a Relationship Manager for over 5years. 
              With extensive experience as a Relationship Manager in banking, 
              I developed strong client relations, communication, and problem-solving skills.
              While in Keystone Bank, I consistently sold the bank‚Äôs products and 
              investment services, brought in new clients and reactivated dormant accounts,
               resulting in revenue increase with over  240%.
It was a great experience working in sales however, as much as I excelled,
 I realized I wanted something that aligned with my passion for technology and innovation.
<br> <br>
Today, I specialize in Frontend Development/Engineering  as a freelancer. 
<br>
Achievements; 

‡ßπ I craft dynamic websites for businesses with user-friendly experiences. 
‡ßπ I have created more than 10 projects which are all available on my GitHub page or my portfolio.
<br> <br>
Combining my experiences and skills administrative support allows me to approach each project with exceptional organization and an eye for efficiency, ensuring that both the technical and administrative aspects are seamless.

As a virtual assistant I assist brands with Remote Administrative Support like: 
<ul>
  <li>
    Calendar & Email Management.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data Entry & Research Assistance
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer Service Support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Social Media Management.

  </li>
  <li>
    Research and Report Generation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Task Automation & Project Management 
  </li>
</ul>


These skills enable me to contribute to various areas, from client relations and customer support to social media management and lead generation. I'm always focused on creating value and saving time for those I work with.
